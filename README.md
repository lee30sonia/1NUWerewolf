One night ultimate werewolf game auto-dealer.

## How to use
1. Sign in to GitHub
2. Click on Code (green button) -> tab Codespaces -> Create codespace on main
3. After setting up, you should see a VS Code window. Click in the bottom block "Terminal" to start typing there (you can also drag to make it bigger).
4. Type `g++ game.cpp -o game` and hit enter.
5. After a few seconds, you should see a new file `game` appearing in the file explorer on the left.
6. Type `./game 0` and hit enter. Enjoy!
7. To quit the game early, press ctrl+c. To start a new game (with different characters assigned), type `./game` followed by a different number.
8. Step 2 can only be done with a computer. After this is done, you can copy the URL of the VS code window (step 3) and open it with a browser on your phone. This URL will still work after closing the window on the computer, as long as you are logged in to the same GitHub account.
